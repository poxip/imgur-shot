# imgur-shot
A simple app made for rapid screenshots sharing.

__imgur-shot__ takes a screenshot using scrot and __uploads__ it to imgur.
## Requirements
* scrot
* libnotify-dev
* libgtk-3-dev
* python-gobject

### Debian Quickstart
```
apt-get install scrot libnotify-dev libgtk-3-dev python-gobject
```
## Installation
```
./setup.py install
```
## Running
To take a screenshot __of whole screen__ execute:
```
imgur-shot
```
use flag __--select__ to select a window or an area
```
imgur-shot --select
```
Use __ESC__ to cancel.
## Setting key bindings
As it's a screenshooting tool, you might want to set up some key bindings.
* __GNOME Shell__:

  The easiest way is to use _gnome-control-center_. If you don't know how to add it, please follow [this simple instruction](http://askubuntu.com/a/73488/281272).

  However you can do it using command line, but you will need to replace ___custom0___ and ___custom1___ with following suffix if you have any other custom shortcuts set (e.g, _custom2_, _custom3_, etc), also [this article from Ubuntu Wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Keybindings) might be useful.
  ```
  gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/ name "imgur-shot"
  gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/ command "imgur-shot"
  gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/ binding "<Primary>1"

  gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom1/ name "imgur-shot select"
  gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom1/ command "imgur-shot --select"
  gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom1/ binding "<Primary>2"
  ```

And then just use __CTRL+1__ to take a screenshot of whole display and __CTRL+2__ to select the area.
